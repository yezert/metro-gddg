> Simple Homepage & blog made with Next.js, MDX and Shadcn UI ðŸš€

A starter kit for sites with blogs, using a modern stack to accelerate website building and gain flexible scalability!

## Stacks details

We used modern tooling to build this example project, including:

- [Next.js 14.1.0](https://nextjs.org) App Router
- React Server Components (RSCs), Suspense, and Server Actions
- Written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)
  - Styling with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
  - [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com) for headless component primitives
  - Icons from [lucide-react](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-react)
  - Dark mode for [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes)
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) lets you use JSX in your markdown content.
  - Markdown styling with [tailwindcss/typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin)

## directory structure

[Store project files outside of app](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/colocation#store-project-files-outside-of-app) according to Shadcn/ui.

And the addDir hierarchy is divided into 3 levels.

1. metadata files via Next.js.
2. Basic site page structure.
3. The concept of [co-location](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/colocation).
